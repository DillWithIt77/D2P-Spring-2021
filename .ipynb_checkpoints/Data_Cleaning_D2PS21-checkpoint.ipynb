    "## Summary\n",
    "A college degree is becoming a necessary requirement of entering the middle class. A college education is also an excellent way to lift people out of poverty. Some high schools have high immediate college enrollments while others have low immediate college enrollments. For any one high school, it is nearly impossible to determine which factors contribute significantly to college enrollment. Often, it is a blend of many factors such as class size, proportion of low income students, teacher pay, number of AP classes offered, and many other factors. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we create an interpretable optimal decision tree to understand which factors make the greatest impact. We will use data from Massachusetts' public schools in 2017 which can be found on Kaggle."

    "The dataset contains 302 fields for 1861 schools. This includes elementary, middle, and high schools as well as schools that serve many grade levels. We will begin by selecting only schools which serve senior high school students. A school which does not serve seniors cannot have immediate college enrollment. We will then select only fields which would be beneficial to this analysis. For example, the number of AP classes taken is relevant while the school's principal is not."
